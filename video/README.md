Zego Express Video Example Topics iOS Demo (Objective-C)

## Prepare the environment

Please ensure that the development environment meets the following technical requirements:

* Xcode 6.0 or higher
* iOS devices or simulators with iOS version no less than 8.0 and audio and video support (the real machine is recommended).
* iOS device already connected to Internet

## Download SDK

The SDK `ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework` required to run the Demo project is missing from this Repository, and needs to be downloaded and placed in the `Libs` folder of the Demo project

> You can use `Terminal` to run the `DownloadSDK.sh` script in this directory, it will automatically download the latest SDK and move it to the corresponding directory.

Or, manually download the SDK from the URL below, unzip it and put the `ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework` under `Libs`

5. The AppID and AppSign required for SDK initialization are missing from the downloaded Demo source. Please refer to [Instructions for getting AppID and AppSign](https://doc.zego.im/API/HideDoc/GetExpressAppIDGuide/GetAppIDGuideline.html) to get AppID and AppSign. If you don't fill in the correct AppID and AppSign, the source code will not run properly, so you need to modify `ZGKeyCenter.m` under the directory `ZegoExpressExample-iOS-OC/Helper` to fill in the correct AppID and AppSign.

## FAQ

1. `The app ID "im.zego.ZegoExpressExample-iOS-OC" cannot be registered to your development team. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again.`

    Refer to **Modify Bundle Identifier and Apple Developer Certificate** above, switch to your own development certificate in `Targets` -> `Signing & Capabilities` and modify `Bundle Identifier` before running.

2. `dyld: Library not loaded`
